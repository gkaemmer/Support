### What if the patients does not know where he/she received care?

The PatientBank patient portal will prompt the patient to enter the following information: 

- Primary care doctor
- Specialist doctor
- Hospital
- Pharmacy
- Lab

Still, the patient may not remember where they received care. This will require the intake coordinator to call the patient to help talk them through the process. 

### Can I request specific information on behalf of the patient?

You can create record requests on behalf of patients that will be sent to them for authorization. You can specify what specific pieces of information are requested from a given institution.

### How/when does the information get uploaded into Epic?

As of now, a patient's records will not be uploaded into Epic. All information may be viewed by the intake staff or doctors in the provider portal. 

### How do I review, make edits or remove documents in PatientBank?

All incoming records are reviewed and duplicate data, blank pages and other redundant records are removed by administrative personnel. If you find incorrect data or have other issues with information stored in PatientBank, please [contact us](/contact).

### Where can I direct technical questions about PatientBank?

Please see [our contact page](/contact). **855-9-PATIENT ext. 5** will contact technical support.

### What if the patient does not have an email address or access to the internet?

If the patient does not have access to email for any reason the intake process will revert back to the manual process. One option is to suggest that patient enlist an adult relative for help. PatientBank allows for “authorized entities” to serve as proxies for patients to request and authorize records. 

### What if the patient is coming from outside the country or has received care outside the country?

We do not currently support gathering records from outside the United States. However, if the patient is able to gather paper copies of their foreign records they may be uploaded to PatientBank. 

### What if the patient has hard copies of their records?

Patients can upload paper copies of their records in two ways:

- Use the PatientBank interface to upload their record.
- Fax the records to PatientBank at (888) 974-0259.

### What if we need to gather information urgently?

Requests are sent to providers as soon as they are initialized by the patient. Therefore, a delay in receiving information may be due to a delay in the patient authorizing a request or the receiving institutions processing and returning the request. If information is needed urgently the intake coordinator may need to contact the patient or the institution to request the information be sent urgently.
