### What if I can’t remember where I received care? 
Not to worry! We can help jog your memory. Here is a list of doctors and institutions you may have: 

- **Primary care doctor**: You primary care doctor is the doctor you see for check-ups and general care.   
- **Specialist doctor**: You may have one or many specialist doctors. Think about what medical conditions you have. Do you have a pacemaker or heart condition? You probably have a cardiologist. Ever had a colonoscopy or endoscopy? This was done by a gastroenterologist.  
- **Hospital**: have you ever been treated in a hospital emergency room or had to stay overnight? Do you receive most of your care at one hospital or several?  
- **Pharmacy**: Where do you pick up your medications? 
- **Lab**: Do you go to a specific lab to get bloodwork? Quest and LabCorp are the two big laboratory chains. 

If this doesn’t help jog your memory, contact [in-person support](/contact).

### Can someone help me work through the process? 
We have a support team available to help you walk through the process of setting up your PatientBank account. Please [see here](/contact) for our contact info and hours.

### Is my data secure? 
At PatientBank, data security is our top priority. We go above and beyond the safety requirements required by HIPAA. Please see our [security page](https://www.patientbank.us/hipaa) for more details. 

### Can I request records on behalf of a family member? 
You can create an account for a family member by signing up for PatientBank under their name and then listing yourself as an "Authorized Entity." You can then create requests for records on their behalf. If you are the legal guardian and they are under 18 years old you may sign for them. If they are older than 18 they will have to sign the authorization (you may help them of course).    

### What if my records are outside the country? 
We currently do not support gathering data from outside the United States. If you think this feature would be useful please [let us know](/contact). If you have paper copies of your records from a foreign country, you can upload them manually using the PatientBank portal.

### My doctor or hospital has asked that I use PatientBank to gather my records. Do I have to use PatientBank to see my doctor? 
No, you may choose not to use PatientBank at anytime and this will not affect your relationship with your doctors. PatientBank is simply a service to help you navigate a complicated and fragmented health care system, we are here to support you. However, if you choose not to use PatientBank or at any time want to stop participating with our service, you may do so.

### Can I stop using PatientBank? 
You can stop using PatientBank at any time by contacting us with a request to opt out. Please be aware that you will lose access to your PatientBank records and it will then take some time to gather them again should you require them.

### What if I don’t seek care at the hospital or doctor's office that requested my records? 
The beauty of PatientBank is that it gives you ownership and control over your data. What this means is that if you choose to go to another hospital or doctor, your information will be available for that visit. 

### Can I edit my record? 
When patients view their records they often find errors in parts of the data. We currently do not support record editing. If you see an error please mention it to your previous and future doctors. If record editing is a feature you feel strongly about please [let us know](/contact). 

### What if part(s) of my record is incorrect? 
As mentioned above, we currently do not support record editing. If you see an error please let your previous and future doctors know. If record editing is a feature you feel strongly about please [let us know](/contact).

### Can my other doctors view my data on PatientBank? 
Yes, at your discretion, you may give your doctors the ability to login and view your records.

### What if my doctor has retired?
If your doctor has left his or her group practice or hospital, your records likely remain at the group practice or hospital. Generally speaking, you should send your requests to the institutions where you received care- your records are (almost) always located at the institution where you were seen.  

### How long will my doctor keep my medical record?
The length of time required to retain your medical record differs from state to state. However, the average time is seven years after the last date of treatment for an adult and seven years after a minor has reached the age of 18 (or 21 in some states).

### Should the requests be sent to the hospital or practice or to my specific doctor?
Generally speaking, you should send your requests to the institutions where you received care- your records are (almost) always located at the institution where you were seen. Be sure to list your doctor’s name on the request so that the institution will know what records to send.
