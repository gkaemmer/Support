### What if I can’t remember where I received care? 
Not to worry! We can help jog your memory. Here is a list of doctors and institutions you may have: 

- **Primary care doctor**: You primary care doctor is the doctor you see for check-ups and general care.   
- **Specialist doctor**: You may have one or many specialist doctors. Think about what medical conditions you have. Do you have a pacemaker or heart condition? You probably have a cardiologist. Ever had a colonoscopy or endoscopy? This was done by a Gastroenterologist.  
- **Hospital**: have you ever been treated in a Hospital Emergency Room or had to stay overnight? Do you receive most of your care at one hospital?  
- **Pharmacy**: Where do you pick up your medications? 
- **Lab**: Do you go to a specific lab to get bloodwork? Quest and LabCorp are the two big laboratory chains. 

If this doesn’t help, contact [in-person support](/contact).

### Can someone help me work through the process? 
We have a support team available to help you walk through the process of setting up your PatientBank account. Please [see here](/contact) for our contact info and hours.

### Is my data secure? 
At PatientBank, data security is our top priority. We go above and beyond the safety requirements required by HIPAA. Please see our [security page](https://www.patientbank.us/hipaa) for more details. 

### What if my records are outside the country? 
We currently do not support data gathering from outside the United States. If you think this feature would be useful please let us know here. If you have hard copies of your records from a foreign country, you can upload them manually using the PatientBank portal.

### Do I have to use PatientBank to see my doctor at YNHH? 
No, you may choose not to use PatientBank at anytime and this will not affect your relationship with YNHH, Smilow or any of your doctors. PatientBank is simply a service to help you navigate a complicated and fragmented health care system, we are here to support you. However, if you choose not to use PatientBank or at any time want to stop participating in our system, you may do so.

### Can I stop using PatientBank? 
You can stop using PatientBank at any time by contacting us with a request to opt out. Please be aware that you will lose access to your PatientBank records and it will then take some time to gather them again should you require them.

### What if I don’t seek care at YNHH? 
The beauty of PatientBank is that it gives the patient ownership and control over their data. What this means is that if you choose to go to another hospital or doctor your information will be available for that visit. 

### Can I edit parts of my record? 
We have seen that when patients look at their records they often find errors in parts of the data. We currently do not support record editing. If you see an error please mention it to your previous and future doctors. If record editing is a feature you feel strongly about please let us know here: 

### What if part(s) of my record is incorrect?

### Can my other doctors view my data on PatientBank? 
Yes, at your discretion, you may give your doctors the ability to login and view your records.
