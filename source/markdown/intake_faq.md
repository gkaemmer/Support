### Can I request specific information on behalf of the patient?

You can create record requests on behalf of patients that will be sent to them for authorization. You can specify what  pieces of information are requested from a given institution by editing the free text in the request template.

### How/when does the information get uploaded into the EMR?

As of now, a patient's records will not be uploaded into individual EMRs. All information may be viewed by the intake staff or doctors in the PatientBank provider portal. In addition, all records may be printed from PatientBank at any time by clicking on a patient, choosing Documents from the drop down menu and clicking on Print All. 

### How do I review, make edits or remove documents in PatientBank?

All incoming records are reviewed by PatientBank staff. Duplicate data, blank pages and other redundant information are removed by administrative personnel. If you find incorrect data or have other issues with information stored in PatientBank, please [contact us](/contact).

### Where can I direct technical questions about PatientBank?

Please see [our contact page](/contact). **855-9-PATIENT ext. 5** will contact technical support.

### What if the patient does not have an email address or access to the internet?

If the patient does not have access to email for any reason, the intake process will revert back to the manual process. One option is to suggest that patient enlist an adult relative for help. PatientBank allows “authorized entities” to serve as proxies for patient and may request and authorize records. 

### What if the patient is coming from outside the country or has received care in a foreign country?

We do not currently support gathering records from outside the United States. However, if the patient is able to gather paper copies of their foreign medical records they may be uploaded to PatientBank via the patient portal. 

### What if the patient has hard copies of their records?

Patients can upload paper copies of their records in two ways:

- Use the PatientBank interface to upload scanned electronic copies.
- Fax the records to PatientBank at (888) 974-0259.

### What if we need to gather information urgently?

Requests are sent to providers as soon as they are authorized by the patient. Therefore, a delay in receiving information may be due to a delay in the patient authorizing a request or a delay in processing at the receiving institutions. If information is needed urgently, the intake coordinator may need to contact the patient or the institution to follow up on the outstanding request.
